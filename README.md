# hostel-management-java-oop

## Project Overview
This is a **console-based Hostel Management System** developed in Java.  
The purpose of this project is to **practice and demonstrate Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts** such as inheritance, abstraction, interfaces, and object interaction.

This project is designed as an **academic learning project**, not a full commercial system.


## Objectives
- Understand how OOP concepts work together in a real-world style system
- Learn how to structure Java classes properly
- Practice clean and understandable Java code
- Improve logical thinking for software design


## OOP Concepts Used

### 1. Inheritance
- A base class `Person` is created
- `Student` class extends `Person`
- This avoids code repetition and improves structure

### 2. Abstraction
- An abstract class `RoomAllocation` defines the rule for room allocation
- Different allocation strategies are implemented using child classes
  - Merit-based allocation
  - First-come-first-serve allocation

### 3. Interface
- `FeeManagement` interface defines fee-related operations
- Different fee calculation methods implement this interface
  - Monthly fee
  - Semester fee

### 4. Object Interaction
- Objects of different classes interact in the main system
- Student, allocation, and fee objects work together to simulate the hostel system


## Technologies Used
- Programming Language: **Java**
- Type: **Console-based application**
- IDE: Any Java-supported IDE (IntelliJ, Eclipse, NetBeans, etc.)


## How to Run the Project
1. Clone or download the repository
2. Open the project in any Java IDE
3. Compile and run the `HostelManagementSystem.java` file
4. View output in the console


## Future Improvements
- Add Warden and Admin roles
- Add room availability tracking
- Connect the system with a database
- Develop a GUI version


## Learning Note
This project was created for **learning purposes** to strengthen understanding of Java OOP concepts.  
The focus is on **concept clarity**, not on advanced features or UI design.
